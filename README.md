# gun-detection-
This project implements a computer visionâ€“based gun detection system using Python and OpenCV. A Haar Cascade classifier (gun_cascade.xml) is used to identify gun-like objects in a live webcam feed. The video frames are preprocessed (grayscale conversion, resizing), and object detection is applied using cv2.CascadeClassifier.
